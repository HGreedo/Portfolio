Thank you for checking out my (Rough) Portfolio!

This is my very first attempt at creating a website from scratch. I tried to utilize flex-box to the very best of my knowledge, while implementing other CSS style effects to add pop and flair. 

This was definitely a challenge, I made my first attempt at this assignment during the first week of class, but as you can clearly tell I will need more practice. 

Anyways, you will find some brief information as well as some of my contact information and images.

I think the biggest thing to work on, would be understanding how to combine float and flex together.

As you can tell, I tried a variety of CSS style elements to try and format my "About Me" section to fit alongside the header with no prevail. -Let me know in your comments if including the writting inside the actual "list item" for "About Me"<ul> on line 42 would have made it easier. 

Anyways, see you in tutoring.
